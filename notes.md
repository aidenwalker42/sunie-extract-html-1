Collapse the <head>, and <svg> tags to make the html files easier to read. main content div is <div id="page-container">

The reason there is a "3" next to portal is due to some CSS stuff ( Ctrl+F this -> content:"3" )

Just collapse the HTML as needed and comment out whatever you dont need

AddNewUserForm is the same as the editing a profile page
